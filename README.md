This project will be beneficial to the efficient collection and distribution of in-kind donations. Organizations can create their account and track the donations that are given by the visitors. Furthermore, this promotes solidarity and service to society as each of us can make an impact by donating whatever we can. The developers -- which are the administrators of the website -- are the ones managing the system to ensure that every information is correct. Additionally, MySQL will be employed for the creating and managing of databases, which is a reliable and easy-to-manage database system.
